## Question? Who is clever? you or machine? or you?

Most developers(including me) become confident when we become an more skilled developer.
We playing some tricks to avoid the code quantity which makes us proud of it.

We plays a lot util we stuck by some advance code we made and here's some example:

Sometimes, when we set hash, we could like to add a default value to avoid makes some trouble of our further implementation. like this:
 [comment1: example](#supplementary	comments)

 But sometimes, it could be frustrated

```ruby
# We makeing a default array into hash in order to get those expected values:
# people["carmen"] = ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3"]
# people["somebody"] = "somebody1", "somebody2"]
# people["nobody"] = []

default = []
people = Hash.new(default)
people["carmen"] << "carmen1"
people["carmen"] << "carmen2"
people["carmen"] << "carmen3"
people["somebody"] << "somebody1"
people["somebody"] << "somebody2"

#Problems:
p people["carmen"] #=> ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3", "somebody1", "somebody2"]
p people["somebody"] #=> ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3", "somebody1", "somebody2"]
p people["nobody"] #=> ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3", "somebody1", "somebody2"]
```

It is tricky as even no body has a value, and that's not we expected. Let's dig into it and we find out the reason:

```ruby
p default #=>  ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3", "somebody1", "somebody2"]
p people #=>  {}
```

it's seems like a Brain sharp but you fingered that, the things that you really manipulate, is the default list instead of hash.

## Soï¼Ÿ how to fix it?

There's 2 ways but I recommend the last one.

* Option 1:

  ```ruby
   default = []
   people = Hash.new(default)
   people["carmen"] += ["carmen1"]
   people["carmen"] += ["carmen2"]
   people["carmen"] += ["carmen3"]
   people["somebody"] += ["somebody1"]
   people["somebody"] += ["somebody2"]

    #Problems:
   p people["carmen"] #=> ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3"]
   p people["somebody"] #=> ["somebody1", "somebody2"]
   p people["nobody"] # => []
   p people #=> {"carmen"=>["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3"], "somebody"=>["somebody1", "somebody2"]}
   p default #=> []
  ```

* Option 2 - Put default value into block

  ```ruby
   people = Hash.new do |hash, default_value|
     hash[default_value] = []
   end

   people["carmen"] << "carmen1"
   people["carmen"] << "carmen2"
   people["carmen"] << "carmen3"
   people["somebody"] << "somebody1"
   people["somebody"] << "somebody2"

   p people["carmen"] #=> ["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3"]
   p people["somebody"] #=> ["somebody1", "somebody2"]
   p people["nobody"] # => []
   p people #=> {"carmen"=>["carmen1", "carmen2", "carmen3"], "somebody"=>["somebody1", "somebody2"]}
  ```


### What I learn?

* Once you feel you confident about something, Be care, because something danger would happen.
* Human is not the most powerful species in the world.
* Keep learning

* The reason why default value in Hash is useful

  ```ruby

  END

  counts = Hash.new(0)

  text.split.map(&:downcase).each do |word|
    counts[word] += 1
  end

  counts
